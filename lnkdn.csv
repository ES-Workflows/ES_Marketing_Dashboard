"On Site with Summit Scaffolding Ltd 🏗️

Anita Sharp dropped in to see our awesome clients at Summit, industry leaders in commercial, industrial, and residential scaffolding across Hamilton, the Waikato, and Bay of Plenty.

Summit’s reputation for safety, efficiency, and top-tier workmanship speaks for itself, and it's always great to see their projects in action.

Client visits like this are an important part of what we do.
• Checking in on project progress
• Catching up with our hard-working boys on site
• Dropping off fresh PPE
• Seeing what phase jobs are in and where support is needed next

Big thanks to the Summit team for having us, it’s always a pleasure working with crews who take pride in what they do.

Stronger partnerships. Safer sites. Solid people.",2w,24,,,https://www.linkedin.com/posts/extrastaff-recruitment_on-site-with-summit-scaffolding-ltd-activity-7374265022799249408-tGq_,,24.0,,
"Mahi done right, and lunch served hot 🍔

Today wasn’t just about getting the job done. It was about showing up, saying thanks, and sharing a meal with the legends who keep the wheels turning.

The boys put in the hard yards day in, day out, so we fired up the grill and served up some well-earned burgers.

Because recognition doesn’t always need a speech. Sometimes, it’s just a full plate, a good laugh, and a moment to breathe.

At Extrastaff, we back our crews, not just with work, but with real support where it counts.

Behind every high-vis vest is a person, putting in the hours, doing the mahi, and showing up rain or shine.

"🏀 Season 5 of the Extrastaff Basketball League wrapped up with a high-energy Finals Night at Kelston Boys High School!

This season brought together the best of Extrastaff Elite and Extrastaff Division teams, with 6 teams walking away with prize money after a fierce competition. 

Big shoutout to Oscar Dunn & Charles Wilkie, who were courtside for the action, joining Dennis & Mikee from Workers First Union to present the trophies to our winners and runners-up. 🏆👏

We’re already looking ahead to Season 6, and this time, we’re planning to enter an Extrastaff Internal Team into the mix. Let’s go! 💪

"At Extrastaff, we don’t just recruit: we support, welcome, and walk alongside those starting new chapters in New Zealand.

Anita Sharp's story is a beautiful reminder of what this work truly means. From being a trusted, familiar face to helping new arrivals feel at home, she truly embodies the heart of our mission.

To our newest recruits from the Philippines, we’re so glad you’re here. 🇵🇭🇳🇿

#TeamExtrastaff #PeopleFirst #GlobalTalent #NewBeginnings #RecruitmentWithPurposeWork at Extrastaff Recruitment Ltd as a Recruitment Consultant has been nothing short of exhilarating, challenging, rewarding, and full of moments that remind me why I love what I do.

This week was different. I got to meet two of our new recruits from the Philippines as they arrived in New Zealand, excited, nervous, already missing home, but driven by purpose. They came here to challenge themselves and create better opportunities for their families.

Coming from Argentina, I can fully relate. I also left home seeking growth, a better lifestyle, and new challenges.

From the ES team helping organize their schedules, accommodation, and inductions, to showing them a bit of Auckland, I’ve realized how much trust they place in us. Becoming a familiar face for them in a new country is something I take seriously, and proudly.

Helping others find their footing while chasing their goals is what makes this journey so worthwhile. 🇵🇭🇦🇷🇳🇿",2w,8,,,https://www.linkedin.com/posts/extrastaff-recruitment_teamextrastaff-peoplefirst-globaltalent-activity-7380735057029849088-5SAU,,8.0,,
